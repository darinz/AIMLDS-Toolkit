## Introduction
R is used in many fields for data analysis, visualization, and reporting. This guide shows practical examples and tools for real-world work.

## Case Studies
- Data analysis in healthcare, finance, social sciences, and more.
- Example: Analyzing patient data to find trends.

```r
# Example: Simple EDA
summary(mtcars)
plot(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$hp)
```

## Reproducible Research
- Use scripts, version control, and literate programming to make your work reproducible.
- Tools: `knitr`, `rmarkdown`, `packrat`, `renv`

```r
# Example: knitr
install.packages("knitr")
library(knitr)
```

## RMarkdown
- Combine code, output, and narrative in a single document.
- Output formats: HTML, PDF, Word.

```markdown
---
title: "RMarkdown Example"
output: html_document
---

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

---

## Practice Exercises
1. Use `summary()` and `plot()` to explore a built-in dataset (e.g., `iris` or `mtcars`).
2. Create a simple RMarkdown document and knit it to HTML.
3. Install and load the `knitr` package.
4. Research a real-world R case study in your field of interest.
